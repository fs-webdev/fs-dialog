I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.

Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.

I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...<br><br>I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!<br><br>Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you.

We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.<br><br>All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!<br><br>Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run.<br><br>Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.</p>

Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!<br><br>Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on!<br><br>You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.<br><br>All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!<br><br>Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run.<br><br>Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.</p>

    <h3>Other Functions and Attributes</h3>
    <div class="demo-snippet fs-card">
      <div class="demo do-not-codify">
        <h5>Open Function Options</h5>
        <p>There are some required parameters to the open function. The function takes one argument which is an options object. The options object always needs a focusBackElement property is required if you want to have the correct element focus when the dialog closes. For anchored dialogs, attachToElement is required.</p>
        <h5>Opt-out of fullscreen on mobile</h5>
        <p>To opt out of making an anchored or modal dialog go fullscreen on mobile devices, add the attribute <code>fullscreen-on-mobile="false"</code></p>
        <h5>autofocus</h5>
        <p>Set the attribute <code>autofocus</code> on the element in the dialog that you want to be focused on first open. If autofocus is not set, the dialog itself gets focus</p>
        <h5>closeAndCloseChildren</h5>
        <p>To close a dialog and all the dialogs above it in the stack, you can call <code>lt;dialog-element&gt;.closeAndCloseChildren()</code> This will automatically use the same direction of transition for all dialogs (whatever the dialog element that you use to call the function has).</p>
        <h5>focusable-component</h5>
        <p>In order to loop users through the modal and anchored dialogs when they press the tab key, we do a query selector to get all focusable elements. If you put a component in the dialog that needs to be able to get focus, please add the attribute <code>focusable-component</code> to it so that we don't break tab looping.</p>
        <h5>closeAllDialogs</h5>
        <p>To close all modal and anchored dialogs on the page you can call <code>FS.dialog.service.closeAllDialogs()</code> This does not close modeless dialogs.</p>
        <h5>Auto-hiding dialogs from initial load</h5>
        <p>While the component is loading, you may get flashes of dialogs being visible/unstyled. To avoid this, add these styles to the css early in your page.</p>
        <pre>
          fs-modeless-dialog,
          fs-modal-dialog,
          fs-anchored-dialog {
            visibility: hidden;
